      <h2 id="about-nehru">About Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
      <p style="color: saddlebrown;">Jawaharlal Nehru; 14 November 1889 - 27 May 1964 was an Indian <em>anti-colonial
          nationalist</em>, statesman,
        secular humanist, social democrat, and author who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th
        century. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years. Nehru
        promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully
        influencing India's arc as a modern nation. Nehru was educated in Englandâ€”at Harrow School and Trinity College,
        Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple.</p>
      <p>He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an
        interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the <strong>Indian
          National Congress</strong>, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and
        eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political
        heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.</p>

      <h3 id="birth-family">Birth and family background</h3>
      <p>Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India. His father, Motilal Nehru
        (1861-1931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the <em>Kashmiri Pandit community</em>, served twice
        as
        president of the Indian National Congress, in 1919 and 1928. His mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868-1938), who
        came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife, his first having
        died in childbirth.</p>
      <p>Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children. The elder of his two sisters, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the
        first female president of the United Nations General Assembly. His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing, became a
        noted writer and authored several books on her brother.</p>

      <h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>
      <p>Nehru described his childhood as a <q>sheltered and uneventful one</q>. He grew up in an atmosphere of
        privilege in wealthy homes, including a palatial estate called the Anand Bhavan. His father had him educated at
        home by private governesses and tutors.</p>
      <p>Influenced by the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' teaching, Nehru became interested in science and
        theosophy. A family friend, Annie Besant subsequently initiated him into the Theosophical Society at age
        thirteen. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring, and he left the society shortly after
        Brooks departed as his tutor. He wrote: <q>For nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways, he
          influenced me greatly</q>.</p>

      <p>Nehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified
        his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, <q>[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm.
          ...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind. ... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of
          Europe.</q></p>
      <p>Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where he
        was nicknamed <q>Joe</q>, G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit,
        influenced him greatly. He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: <q>Visions of similar deeds in
          India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind, India and Italy got strangely
          mixed together.</q></p>
