      <section class="about-jn">
        <p>Jawaharlal Nehru; 14 November 1889 - 27 May 1964 was an Indian <em>anti-colonial nationalist</em>, statesman,
          secular humanist, social democrat, and author who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th
          century. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years.
          Nehru
          promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully
          influencing India's arc as a modern nation. Nehru was educated in Englandâ€”at Harrow School and Trinity
          College,
          Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple.</p>
        <p>He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an
          interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the <strong>Indian
            National Congress</strong>, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and
          eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his
          political
          heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.</p>

      <section class="about-jn">
        <p>Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India. His father, Motilal Nehru
          (1861-1931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the <em>Kashmiri Pandit community</em>, served
          twice as
          president of the Indian National Congress, in 1919 and 1928. His mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868-1938), who
          came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife, his first having
          died in childbirth.</p>
        <p>Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children. The elder of his two sisters, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the
          first female president of the United Nations General Assembly. His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing, became
          a
          noted writer and authored several books on her brother.</p>

      <h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>

        <p>Nehru described his childhood as a <q>sheltered and uneventful one</q>. He grew up in an atmosphere of
          privilege in wealthy homes, including a palatial estate called the Anand Bhavan. His father had him educated
          at
          home by private governesses and tutors.</p>
        <p>Influenced by the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' teaching, Nehru became interested in science and
          theosophy. A family friend, Annie Besant subsequently initiated him into the Theosophical Society at age
          thirteen. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring, and he left the society shortly
          after
          Brooks departed as his tutor. He wrote: <q>For nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways, he
            influenced me greatly</q>.</p>

      <h3 id="youth">Youth</h3>
      <section class="about-jn">
        <p class="youth">Nehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese
          War intensified his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, <q>[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my
            enthusiasm. ...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind. ... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from
            the thraldom of Europe.</q></p>
        <p>Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where he
          was nicknamed <q>Joe</q>, G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic
          merit, influenced him greatly. He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: <q>Visions of similar
            deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind, India and Italy got
            strangely mixed together.</q></p>
